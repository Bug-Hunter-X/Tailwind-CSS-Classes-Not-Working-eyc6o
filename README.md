# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Working

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: classes failing to apply to elements, despite seeming to be correctly included.

## Bug Report

The `bug.js` file shows a simple example where a Tailwind CSS class (`text-red-500`) fails to style the relevant div element.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file illustrates a potential solution.  This may involve double-checking several aspects of your Tailwind configuration including the build process and purge options to make sure Tailwind knows about all the CSS classes that you intend to use in your application.
